            ðŸš¨ **Duplicate Code Found!** ðŸš¨  
            - The repository has duplicate code that needs refactoring.  
            - View the full report in the [GitHub Artifacts](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})  

            Suggested Fixes:  
            - Use reusable functions instead of repeated code blocks.  
            - Apply the **DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself).  
            - Modularize common logic into shared utilities.  
            - Consider leveraging **GitHub Copilot** for refactoring suggestions.
